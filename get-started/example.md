# Example

This package contains a full example application - prebuilt for Android and Windows - showcasing the most important features of this package.

Feel free to use the app as a starting point for your application, it contains some useful UI patterns.

{% hint style="danger" %}
By using the example application, you must comply to your tile server's ToS.

OpenStreetMap's (the default throughout the application) can be [found here](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles). If you cannot comply to these rules, you should find one that you can comply to and get the appropriate source URL (which can be customised in the application).
{% endhint %}

## Android

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/AndroidExampleApplication.apk" %}
.apk Example Application
{% endfile %}

To run the prebuilt Android application on most devices, download the above file to your device and execute it to install it.

The operating system may request permissions to install applications from unknown sources: you must allow this.

After installation, it will appear in the launcher like any other application.

## Windows

{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/WindowsExampleApplication.zip" %}
Zipped Example Application
{% endfile %}

To run the prebuilt Windows application, download the above archive and extract it to a suitable location on your system.

Then run the 'example.exe' program it contains: it does not require any installation.

## Other Platforms

For other platforms, there are no prebuilt applications.

You'll [clone this project](https://github.com/JaffaKetchup/flutter\_map\_tile\_caching.git), open the 'example' directory, and then build for your desired platform using Dart and Flutter as normal.
