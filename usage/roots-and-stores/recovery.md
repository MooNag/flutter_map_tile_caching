# Recovery

```dart
FlutterMapTileCaching.instance.rootDirectory.recovery;
```

The recovery system is designed to rescue failed bulk downloads, in the event of an unexpected error - such as a fatal crash or other external event.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You should not rely on the recovery system to be 100% reliable, even though it is built to be as close to that as possible.
{% endhint %}

## ID System

Recoverable regions are identified internally by an `int` ID number. All the methods above take this ID number. It is almost guaranteed that this number is unique, and it must be for the system to work correctly.
