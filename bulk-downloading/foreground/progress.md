# 4âƒ£ Listen For Progress

To listen for progress events, you can listen to the `Stream` of `DownloadProgress` events returned by the `startForeground()` method.

Listening can be done through any method, such as `listen()` or the `await for` loop.

{% hint style="warning" %}
To actually start downloading any tiles, you must attach a listener to the returned `Stream`, even if you do not plan to use the [#available-statistics](progress.md#available-statistics "mention").
{% endhint %}
